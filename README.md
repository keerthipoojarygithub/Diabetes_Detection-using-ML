# Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes using various machine learning algorithms based on input parameters such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, and more. The web application is developed using Django, integrated with machine learning models.

## Features
- User input form for relevant medical details
- Real-time prediction of diabetes
- Machine learning algorithms used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Web interface developed using Django

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Django
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy

### Usage

-Fill in the form with the required details.

-Click on the Predict button to see the results.


### Machine Learning Models

Logistic Regression: Provides a probability-based prediction.

SVM: Classifies the data based on a hyperplane.

Random Forest: Provides an ensemble learning approach.

KNN: Predicts based on neighbors.

Naive Bayes: Uses Bayes' Theorem for classification.

Gradient Boosting: Combines weak learners to improve accuracy.
